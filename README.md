## Project Description
I always thought that most laborary power supplies (LPS) take up to much bench space. This design is just 2.5 inches by 5.5 inches and runs off a wall wart or it can be powered from a lithium battery pack. The unit's specs are 0 to 15 volts output with a maximum output current of 1.5 amps. It has two output adjustable voltage presets with defaults of 5 and 3.3 volts. It has two rotary encoders, one for voltage control and the other for current limiting. Pressing an encoder button will change it's adjustement range. There is one additional button for output enable. The LPS can also be controlled remotely via USB using ModBus. There is also a realtime analog current bar graph on the oled display.
